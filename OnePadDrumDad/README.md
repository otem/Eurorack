Teensy 3.2 MIDI Drum Sequencer

[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4vuTCDDcHPk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuTCDDcHPk)

A simple MIDI Sequencer in Eurorack format. I set this up for my SP-404, my Volca Drum, and one extra MIDI channel. 
Code puts the channles at 9 to 11 but that can be changed.
